# Fonts
There are 2 kinds of fonts in MGE

- Sprite font
- SDF font

## Sprite Fonts
Sprite fonts is are pre-rendered images of characters. They are very simple in functionality but the font only looks good at the resolution they were rendered at. In order for text to look good at 64 pixels, the sprites have to be rendered at 64 pixels.

But what if there was some kind of black magic to get more pixels from less?

Well there is!
